## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/yjunechoe/ggtrace/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("yjunechoe/ggtrace")
```

More on the ðŸ“¦ package website: [https://yjunechoe.github.io/ggtrace](https://yjunechoe.github.io/ggtrace)

## Getting started

`{ggtrace}` is a **functional interface to ggplot2 internals**. You need to know a little bit about `{ggplot2}` internals to make the most out of `{ggtrace}`.

If you prefer watching videos, here are three talks on the topic in increasing complexity:

- [Talk at JSM 2023](https://youtu.be/613Q0j6Kjm0?feature=shared) (+ [paper](https://yjunechoe.github.io/static/papers/Choe_2022_SublayerGG.pdf))

- [Talk at rstudioconf 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUBnitXf5mk&list=PL9HYL-VRX0oTOwqzVtL_q5T8MNrzn0mdH&index=38) (+ [materials](https://github.com/yjunechoe/ggtrace-rstudioconf2022))

- [Talk at useR! 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JX8zu4QxMg&t=2959s) (+ [materials](https://github.com/yjunechoe/ggtrace-user2022))

## Motivation

Broadly speaking, `{ggtrace}` was designed with two goals in mind:

### 1. Understanding Sublayer Modularity

To help users write more expressive layer code using [delayed aesthetic evaluation](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/aes_eval.html). The family of `layer_*()` extractor functions return snapshots of layer data in the internals, to help scaffold a mental model of `{ggplot2}` internals as a data wrangling pipeline. See `` ?`sublayer-data` ``

</p>

### 2. Facilitating the User-Developer Transition

To empower users to start developing their own extensions This is achieved via a family of `inspect_*()`, `capture_*()`, and `highjack_*()` workflow functions, which provide a functional interface into the object-oriented design of the internals (the `<ggproto>` OOP).

You can read the full motivation behind `{ggtrace}` in the [Pedagogical Philosophy](https://yjunechoe.github.io/ggtrace/articles/pedagogical-philosophy.html) vignette.

## Playground

The best way to learn `{ggtrace}` and `{ggplot2}` internals is by playing around and breaking things as you go.

In that spirit, you can take `{ggtrace}` for a spin on the **ggplot2 layer explorer**.
