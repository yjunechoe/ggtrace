## Installation

You can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/yjunechoe/ggtrace/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("yjunechoe/ggtrace")
```

More on the ðŸ“¦ package website: <https://yjunechoe.github.io/ggtrace>

## Getting started

`{ggtrace}` is a **functional interface to ggplot2 internals**. A little
bit of knowledge about `{ggplot2}` internals is required to make the
most use out of `{ggtrace}`. You can watch one of these videos for a
quick showcase.

## Description

Broadly speaking, `{ggtrace}` was designed with two goals in mind:

### 1. Understanding Sublayer Modularity

To help users write more expressive layer code using [delayed aesthetic
evaluation](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/aes_eval.html). The
family of `layer_*()` extractor functions return snapshots of layer data
in the internals, to help scaffold a mental model of `{ggplot2}`
internals as a data wrangling pipeline. See `` ?`sublayer-data` ``

</p>

### 2. Facilitating the User-Developer Transition

To empower users to start developing their own extensions This is
achieved via a family of `inspect_*()`, `capture_*()`, and
`highjack_*()` workflow functions, which provide a functional interface
into the object-oriented design of the internals (the `<ggproto>` OOP).

You can read the full motivation behind `{ggtrace}` in the [Pedagogical
Philosophy](https://yjunechoe.github.io/ggtrace/articles/pedagogical-philosophy.html)
vignette.

## Playground

The best way to learn `{ggtrace}` and `{ggplot2}` internals is by
playing around and breaking things as you go.

In that spirit, you can take `{ggtrace}` for a spin on the [ggplot2
Layer Explorer](https://yjunechoe.github.io/ggplot2-layer-explorer/)
shiny app.
