- title: Workflows (experimental; due for v0.5)
  desc: >
    These high-level functions take a ggplot object and a ggproto method and allows
    interactions with the ggplot's build pipeline as it is evaluated. Functions are
    grouped into four "workflows": Inspect, Capture, Highjack, and Edit.


- subtitle: Inspect
  desc: >
    Return values from a method's execution environment for inspection and wrangling
  contents:
  - ggtrace_inspect_n
  - ggtrace_inspect_return

- subtitle: Capture
  desc: >
    Take a snapshot of a method's execution state, exposing it as a function/environment
  contents:
  - ggtrace_capture_fn
  - ggtrace_capture_env

- subtitle: Highjack
  desc: >
    Manipulate a method's behavior as it runs and return the resulting the graphical output
  contents:
  - ggtrace_highjack_return

- subtitle: Edit
  desc: >
    Interactively edit a method's code in a text editor (non-programmatic)
  contents:
  - ggedit

- title: Extending base::trace()
  desc: >
    The low-level function `ggtrace()` and the wrapper function `with_ggtrace()` extend
    `base::trace()` by managing the **state** of trace expressions, which allow for
    contiguity over multiple injections and the inspection of tracedumps. Unlike the
    high-level workflow functions, `ggtrace()` relies on the "side effect" of methods
    of functions and methods being traced, which must be explicitly reverted with `gguntrace()`.

    Lower-level functions for finer control over injecting expressions with trace
  contents:
  - ggtrace
  - gguntrace
  - with_ggtrace

- subtitle: Tracedumps
  desc: >
    Log and interact with the output of expressions injected with trace
