- title: Workflows
  desc: >
    These high-level functions take a ggplot object and a function or ggproto method,
    allowing interactions with the ggplot's build pipeline as it is evaluated. Functions
    grouped into three "workflows": Inspect, Capture, and Highjack.
  contents:
  - with_ggtrace

- subtitle: Inspect
  desc: >
    Return values from or information about a method's execution state for inspection
  contents:
  - ggtrace_inspect_n
  - ggtrace_inspect_which
  - ggtrace_inspect_vars
  - ggtrace_inspect_args
  - ggtrace_inspect_return

- subtitle: Capture
  desc: >
    Take a snapshot of a method's execution state, returning it as a function or environment
  contents:
  - ggtrace_capture_fn
  - ggtrace_capture_env

- subtitle: Highjack
  desc: >
    Manipulate a method's behavior as it runs and return the modified graphical output
  contents:
  - ggtrace_highjack_args
  - ggtrace_highjack_return


- title: Extending base::trace()
  desc: >
    The low-level function `ggtrace()` extends `base::trace()` by managing the **state** of
    injected expressions (traces), which allows for contiguity across multiple traces and
    the inspection of evaluated expressions logged to the tracedump, via `last_ggtrace()` and
    `global_ggtrace()`. Unlike the high-level workflow functions, `ggtrace()` relies on the
    "side effect" of functions and methods being traced, which can be restored with `gguntrace()`.
