## Short version

Are you a **user** wanting to fully master the grammar of `{ggplot2}`? Start [here](https://github.com/yjunechoe/ggtrace-rstudioconf2022)!

Are you an **aspiring developer** wanting to extend `{ggplot2}`? Start [here](https://github.com/yjunechoe/ggtrace-user2022)!

## Long version

There's a lot that can be said about ggplot internals, and what you can get from using `{ggtrace}` depends on how comfortable you are with `{ggplot2}` and ggplot internals. Whether you're here because you want to become a better ggplot user or because you're an aspiring extension developer, `{ggtrace}` has you covered for all stages of your `{ggplot2}` journey!

### Stage 0 (user)

If this is your first time hearing about ggplot internals, I recommend starting with [part 1 of my blog post series on delayed aesthetic evaluation](https://yjunechoe.github.io/posts/2022-03-10-ggplot2-delayed-aes-1/), a case study of [somewhat niche {ggplot2} functions](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/aes_eval.html) that lie at the intersection between user-facing code and ggplot internals. You might also want to start with another blog post of mine on [stat_*() layers](https://yjunechoe.github.io/posts/2020-09-26-demystifying-stat-layers-ggplot2/), for extra scaffolding. These will give you minimal background on ggplot internals to get started.

### Stage 1 (advanced user)

Then, you can watch my [rstudio::conf(2022) talk on {ggtrace} and ggplot internals](https://github.com/yjunechoe/ggtrace-rstudioconf2022). If that felt a little too fast/dense, you can watch a [slower (hour-long), broken down version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhMI-GvppMo&list=PL3x6DOfs2NGhUxGvu46tXQtBl0qyTcDet&index=28) of me covering the same content. This is where I showcase the _inspect_ family of workflow functions in `{ggtrace}` and you also will be introduced to [`ggproto`](https://ggplot2-book.org/internals.html#introducing-ggproto). The talk(s) essentially covers the contents of [Chapter 20.2 of the ggplot2 book](https://ggplot2-book.org/internals.html#ggplotbuild), but with emphasis on practicality for the user. I'd actually recommend reading the entire book chapter anyways (or read it with a recording of me going over [Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__yndiht_gw&list=PL3x6DOfs2NGhUxGvu46tXQtBl0qyTcDet&index=24) and [Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBROPy_BeU&list=PL3x6DOfs2NGhUxGvu46tXQtBl0qyTcDet&index=26) of the chapter), as it covers many fundamental concepts that may come off as unintuitive at first. As you read through it, I highly recommend referencing [Emi Tanaka](https://twitter.com/statsgen)'s awesome [slides on ggplot2 internals](https://emitanaka.org/datavis-adv-workshop/slides/day1-session2.html) and [Bob Rudis](https://twitter.com/hrbrmstr)'s [short chapter on demystifying ggplot2](https://rud.is/books/creating-ggplot2-extensions/demystifying-ggplot2.html) as companion guides.

### Stage 2 (aspiring developer)

If you're not scared away by ggproto methods and want to keep exploring the internals, you should continue by watching [Thomas Lin Pedersen](https://twitter.com/thomasp85)'s [rstudio::conf(2020) talk on extending ggplot](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/rstudioconf-2020/extending-your-ability-to-extend-ggplot2/), which gives a nice overview of what kind of ggproto methods exist and what the most relevant ones are / what they do. Now you're entering developer territory. In case you want a more comprehensive documentation on ggproto (though not necessary to read them at this stage), check out the [package vignette on ggproto](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggplot2-ggproto.html) and [Brodie Gaslam](https://twitter.com/BrodieGaslam)'s even more comprehensive [unofficial reference for ggplot internals](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brodieG/ggbg/development/inst/doc/extensions.html#ggproto-method).

You can follow up on Thomas's talk by watching my [useR! 2022 talk on {ggtrace} and ggplot internals](https://github.com/yjunechoe/ggtrace-user2022), which showcases all workflows in `{ggtrace}` (_inspect_, _capture_, _highjack_) for interacting with ggproto methods. The [part 2 of my blog post series on delayed aesthetic evaluation](https://yjunechoe.github.io/posts/2022-07-06-ggplot2-delayed-aes-2/) picks up where I left off in that talk to expand on the possible extension points to different `Stat` methods.

That leads nicely into the [case study chapter of the ggplot2 book](https://ggplot2-book.org/spring1.html). It's a huge chapter, so if you want some diversity you can also reference Emi's [slides on writing ggplot2 extensions ggplot](https://emitanaka.org/datavis-adv-workshop/slides/day1-session3.html) and read the [package vignette on extending ggplot](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/articles/extending-ggplot2.html#creating-your-own-theme) side-by-side, which touches on the same topics but with different examples. In the process, you'll inevitably encounter `{grid}`, which is itself a whole 'nother monster. There are a lot of resources on `{grid}`, most notably Paul's book [R Graphics (3rd edition)](https://www.routledge.com/R-Graphics-Third-Edition/Murrell/p/book/9780367780692), but there are also some resources written with ggplot internals in mind, like yet another one of Emi's [slides](https://emitanaka.org/datavis-adv-workshop/slides/day1-session1.html), and functions for interacting with `{gtable}` objects from [`{lemon}`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lemon/vignettes/gtable_show_lemonade.html) and [`{gridExtra}`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gridExtra/vignettes/gtable.html).

### Stage 4 (developer)

At this point you know enough internals to go off and write your own extensions. You are now a _developer_ (even if you're just starting!) - your training wheels are off and you're in the territory of figuring things out for yourself. A few people have written on the topic of debugging ggplot, including [Hiroaki Yutani](https://twitter.com/yutannihilat_en)'s [blog post on using browser() for debugging ggproto methods](https://yutani.rbind.io/post/a-tip-to-debug-ggplot2/) and [Dewey Dunnington](https://twitter.com/paleolimbot)'s [{ggdebug}](https://github.com/paleolimbot/ggdebug) package which gives you freakishly powerful control over the internals. People have also written packages for less "intrusive" ways of debugging and interacting with the internals, including [{gginnards}](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gginnards/vignettes/user-guide-1.html) by [Pedro J. Aphalo](https://github.com/aphalo) and [{gggrid}](https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~paul/Reports/gggrid/gggrid.html) by [Paul Murrell](https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~paul/).

Standing on the shoulders of these giants, `{ggtrace}` aims to offer the best of both worlds, with high-level workflow functions in the form of `ggtrace_{action}_{value}()`, the low-level functions `ggtrace()` and `with_ggtrace()`, and the interactive debugging functions `ggedit()` and `ggdebugonce()`. There's not a whole lot of new stuff that ggtrace offers in this space (the package isn't even _that_ much code) but it embodies a transformative reframing of ggplot internals as functional programming, the kind that we're familiar with as R users. I hope this overview of what people have written about ggplot internals over the years can compensate for the (at least current) lack of vignettes in the package.

Lastly, `{ggplot2}` is always evolving! It might not be obvious as users, but the internals are undergoing constant change. So at some point you might also want to start keeping an eye on the [Github issues](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/issues). It's also a nice place to be because you can eavesdrop on the thoughts and insights from the core developers (e.g., [should users be able to specify pieces of a `scale_*()` modularly?](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/issues/4269), [should the guides system be converted to ggproto?](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/issues/3329), [should layers get "state"?](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/issues/3175)), which can actually directly help you understand the motivation behind how and why things in the internals are designed that way.
