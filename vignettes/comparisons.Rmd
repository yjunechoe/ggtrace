```

## Sneak peak:

- An overview of methods for debugging/inspecting ggplot and their pros/cons
    - `debug()`/`debugonce()`
    - `browser()` + `load_all()`
    - `layer_data()`
    - `trace()`
- A review and discussion of what came before {ggtrace} (the shoulders of giants)
    - [Hiroaki Yutani](https://twitter.com/yutannihilat_en)'s [blog post on {ggplot2} + browser()](https://yutani.rbind.io/post/a-tip-to-debug-ggplot2/)
    - [Pedro J. Aphalo](https://github.com/aphalo)'s [{gginnards}](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gginnards/vignettes/user-guide-1.html)
    - [Brodie Gaslam](https://twitter.com/BrodieGaslam)'s [{ggbg}](https://github.com/brodieG/ggbg) and [ggplot2 internals reference document](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brodieG/ggbg/development/inst/doc/extensions.html) 
    - [Dewey Dunnington](https://twitter.com/paleolimbot)'s [{ggdebug}](https://github.com/paleolimbot/ggdebug), which also features a function of the same name `ggdebug::ggtrace` but which does not use `trace()`. Maybe things have changed in the last 2-3 years, but `trace()` and `untrace()` do work with ggproto methods, as this package shows!
